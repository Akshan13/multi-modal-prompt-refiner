I need a custom CRM system for my real estate business. The system should manage client contacts, track property listings, and schedule property viewings. It must integrate with Gmail for email automation and Google Calendar for appointment scheduling. We have 5 sales agents who need simultaneous access. Budget is $8000 and we need it deployed within 4 months. The system should be web-based and mobile-responsive.
